        <p>Jamaica is an island in the Caribbean Sea, known for its beautiful beaches and warm climate. The capital city is Kingston. The country gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1962 and has the British monarch as its ceremonial head of state. English is the official language, but many Jamaicans speak Jamaican Patois. Reggae music, which started in Jamaica, is famous worldwide, and Bob Marley is its most well-known artist. Jamaica also grows products like coffee, bananas, and sugar. The island has a strong African heritage, which is an important part of its culture.</p>
