			<p class="desk"> Labor Day in Jamaica, observed on May 23rd, honors the contributions of workers and commemorates the 1938 labor rebellion that led to significant labor reforms. The day is marked by community service projects, where Jamaicans come together to improve public spaces, such as cleaning, painting, and tree planting. It’s a celebration of the nation’s progress in workers' rights and a reminder of the value of hard work and community solidarity. </p>

			<h3 class="header"> Language </h3>
			<img class="imgs" src="images/jamaica.png" height="200px">
			<hr class="break"> 
			<p class="desk"> The official language of Jamaica is English, but the most widely spoken language is Jamaican Patois (Creole). Jamaican Patois is an English-based Creole with influences from African languages, as well as Spanish, Portuguese, and indigenous Jamaican terms. While English is used in formal settings like government, education, and media, Patois is the language of everyday conversation and reflects the island's cultural identity. The use of Patois in music, particularly in Reggae and Dancehall, has also contributed to its global recognition. </p>
